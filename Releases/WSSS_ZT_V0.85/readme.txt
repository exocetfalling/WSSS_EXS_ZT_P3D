Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) for P3D V4. 

By Zenith Creations (Zachary Tay). 

This add-on is the culmination of over a year’s worth of work on various aspects of the airport. The scope has increased tremendously, from merely an amendment of the taxi signs to new 3-D models and various airport landmarks, as well as satellite imagery for the airport area. A basic GSX configuration is also included, subject to change in future. You need SODE for the jetways, it's free. 

Features:
- Phase IV compliant taxi signs, correct as of 23/12/2021
- Custom terminal, satellite imagery, tower and Jewel objects
- SODE jetways 
- Apron lighting 

Known issues:
02R/20L signs are incomplete
Models are very basic and could use improvement 

Installation:
1. Extract the contents of WSSS_ZT_V0.85 into your Prepar3D V4 root folder.
2. Only if you don’t have GSX, extract the contents of the SODE folder into C:\ProgramData\12bPilot\SODE\. Move any other WSSS files (Imaginesim etc.) out of the C:\ProgramData\12bPilot\SODE\xml\ folder. 
3. Activate in Scenery Library, with the imagery BELOW the airport. This is very important!

I hope you'll enjoy this improvement over the default WSSS, and Merry Christmas.
